# markovMosquitos

This repo was created to continue the work started with the "Walking Dead" mosquito movement calibration routines (https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MoNeT/tree/master/Markov). It should, in time, provide with the means to calibrate the movement kernels in a spatially explicit landscape taking into account the point types (sugar, resting, blood-feeding, egg-laying) and the distances between them.
